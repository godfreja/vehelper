VE Helper

VE Helper is a .NET Application intended to fill out ARRL VEC 605 Forms and
answer sheets. Fields can be auto populated from a local copy of the FCC
amateur radio database. I have developed a similar program for the Mac
and have found that it can really speed up test sessions. I want a new
version that can be more widely used.

This program will be developed in C# using Mono.
